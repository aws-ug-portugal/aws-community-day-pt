AI and machine learning are evolving fast—businesses can’t afford to spend months building platforms from scratch while competitors surge ahead. But guess what? Putting together a robust, scalable AI/ML platform is easier than it sounds if you have a clear maturity plan and leverage the right tools. From serverless solutions like SageMaker, and Databricks to custom setups pieced together with a few well-chosen services, there’s a world of possibilities waiting for you.

In this talk, I’ll share how we rolled out an AI/ML platform at Apotea in just eight weeks—getting three products into production without the usual headaches. We’ll explore how distributed, serverless architectures can drastically cut down build times while keeping costs and complexity in check. If you’ve ever wondered whether you can scale AI without sacrificing speed or sanity, come learn how to make it happen. Let’s prove that “fast” and “scalable” don’t have to be opposites.
