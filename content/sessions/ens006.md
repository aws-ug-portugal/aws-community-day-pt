In this talk, Martin walks through he designed, built, and operates their Property Listings MCP to power a seamless AI chat interface for finding and creating listings. 

Attendees will see how MCP lets an LLM safely call backend tools—like listing search, enrichment, and publishing—while keeping system context tight and auditable. 

You’ll leave with a practical template for standing up your own MCP server, wiring it to a chat client, and hardening it for production.
