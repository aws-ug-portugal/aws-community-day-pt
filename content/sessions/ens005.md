You’ve been hearing a lot about security best practices, but you’re not convinced they can really make a difference? Do you think your resources are safe only because nobody would notice your random IP address?
In this presentation, I will share real-life attack scenarios to convince you that misconfigurations can have dire consequences.
Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of real-world examples, complete with screenshots.
I will discuss multiple different attack vectors to demonstrate the diverse range of threats organizations face in today's digital landscape.
As an AWS Ambassador, I will focus on AWS-specific scenarios, but it's crucial to note that similar risks apply to all major public clouds. Don't miss this talk on cloud security and how to protect your organization's valuable assets.
