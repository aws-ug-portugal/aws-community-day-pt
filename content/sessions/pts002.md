In the ancient land of AWSia, a mysterious scroll has surfaced — one that holds the secret to infinite scalability without a single server… the Lambda Scroll.

Join us for a short, interactive fantasy adventure that introduces serverless computing with AWS Lambda. You’ll take on the role of a cloud adventurer — be it a Mage (Developer), Warrior (Solutions Architect), or Ranger (DevOps) — and work together to defeat the Latency Beast and restore uptime to the realm.

Inspired by Dungeons & Dragons and set in a playful fantasy world, this mini-session blends storytelling, decision-making, and real AWS concepts to make learning AWS feel like an epic quest.

What to expect:
- A guided, D&D-style AWS roleplay experience
- Interactive decisions & dice rolls
- A light introduction to Lambda, serverless architecture, and cloud events
- Laughs, analogies, and cloud wisdom

No AWS or D&D experience required. Just bring your imagination!
