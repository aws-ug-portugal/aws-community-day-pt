In today's ultra-fast-paced world, gaining real-time insights and generating information from the data has become fundamental; it is no longer a nice to have or a luxury only supported by large and healthy organizations. This session explores the synergy between Event Mesh and Data Mesh architectures and how, when implemented, they provide a solid foundation to support informed decisions at the speed of the events.
Discover how an event mesh effectively simplifies complexities of data distribution within a decentralized data mesh environment, enabling a seamless flow of information across business domains.
Through compelling examples and a real-world use case, we will illustrate how this symbiotic relationship empowers organizations to dismantle data silos, accelerate innovation, and fully harness the potential of real-time data for actionable insights, providing the confidence that these concepts are not just theoretical but highly practical.
