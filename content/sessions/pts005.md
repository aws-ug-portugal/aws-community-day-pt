AWS billing is often perceived as straightforwardâ€”pay for what you use. In practice, however, it hides a layer of complexity that many organizations only discover after adoption. Beyond the visible line items, factors such as data transfer, cross-region traffic, misaligned pricing models, and unused commitments can silently drive costs. This session will uncover the lesser-known aspects of AWS billing, highlight common pitfalls, and provide practical strategies to gain visibility, optimize spend, and avoid unexpected surprises.
