Choosing the right team can compress years into months. In this sponsored session by tecRacer (Platinum Sponsor), I’ll share the playbook behind my jump from full-stack dev to AWS Hero, Golden Jacket, Champion Instructor—and now Head of tecRacer Portugal. We’ll get practical about mentorship, high-impact projects, certification paths, community impact, and how these compound your value (and yes, career growth) fast. After a quick story, it’s an open AMA—ask anything about careers, hiring, tech stacks, and life at tecRacer.
