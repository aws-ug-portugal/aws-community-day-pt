Not every driver can handle a truck.
Not every doctor can operate on a goldfish.

Every day, I help companies identify weaknesses in their AWS infrastructure. This time, I’m inviting you behind the scenes to see how I work. I’ll walk you through the specific areas I always check, common mistakes I find almost everywhere, and real situations where audits saved my clients thousands of dollars or prevented major incidents. You’ll see why looking at AWS from the perspective of not only an administrator but also a security researcher helps uncover far more.
