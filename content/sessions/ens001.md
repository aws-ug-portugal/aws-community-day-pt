Ever had a cloud bill you weren't expecting? I have - let's talk about it!

Managing cloud costs effectively isn't just about cutting expenses; it's about building smart, adaptable systems that respond to events in real time. In this intermediate session for data professionals, cloud architects and DevOps engineers, we'll explore how event-based architectures can transform how you monitor, manage and optimise cloud spend, spotlighting AWS services like Step Functions, CloudTrail and EventBridge.

We'll explore:

Evaluating Options: Assess cloud-native tools and techniques, and select the optimal solution for your use case based on context, risk and operational goals.

Automating Cost Control: Discover how cloud services can work together to build dynamic workflows that detect and respond to events and anomalies.

Building the Solution: Step-by-step guidance for designing, deploying and maintaining architectures that effectively monitor and manage costs.

Live AWS demos will bring these concepts to life with real-time cost optimisation in action.

This session offers practical insights to help you implement scalable, event-based solutions, enhancing your cloud infrastructure and transforming your approach to cost control.
