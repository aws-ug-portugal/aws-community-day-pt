AWS offers a comprehensive, purpose-built portfolio of managed databases and storage services that together power modern, resilient, and cost‑efficient applications at any scale. Together, AWS databases and storage form a tightly integrated stack—accelerating development, optimizing cost/performance, and simplifying operations across different scenarios so teams can focus on innovation rather than infrastructure. For self-managed databases, the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP brings enterprise-grade data management to AWS databases, delivering instant, space‑efficient cloning and fast policy‑driven backups using Application Aware-Snapshots, that can reduce your SLAs and accelerate your development cycles!
